            The States are empowered to enact personal laws that decide issues
            such as succession, marriage and divorce, in their endeavour to
            secure a uniform civil code (UCC), Law Minister Kiren Rijiju
            informed the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The Minister made these
            remarks in a written reply to a question posed by Communist Party of
            India (Marxist) member John Brittas, asking whether the Centre was
            aware of the States formulating their own laws with respect to the
            uniform civil code. “Yes sir,” said Mr. Rijiju. “Article 44 of the
            Constitution provides that the State shall endeavour to secure for
            the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of
            India.”
